1. ### What is React Native and how does it differ from React
    ---
    React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It enables the development of cross-platform apps with a single codebase that runs on both iOS and Android.     
    While React is primarily for building web interfaces, React Native focuses on mobile UI components. React Native uses native components, providing a more authentic feel and better performance than  web-based solutions.

2. ### Explain the concept of JSX in React Native.
   ---
   JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension in React Native that allows embedding HTML-like elements within JavaScript code. It simplifies UI rendering by letting developers write components using a familiar HTML structure. JSX gets transpiled into JavaScript, enabling React Native components to be expressed in a more readable and intuitive format.
